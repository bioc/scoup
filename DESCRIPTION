Description: An elaborate population genetics framework that facilitates
             straightforward simulation of codon genetic sequences
             subjected to different degrees and/or patterns of Darwinian
             selection. The evolutionary framework was built upon the
             fitness landscape paradigm of Sewall Wright, as popularised
             by the mutation-selection model of Halpern and Bruno. This
             enabled realistic evolutionary settings of living organisms
             to be included seamlessly. For example, an
             Ornstein-Uhlenbeck algorithm inspired fitness update
             approach is incorporated herein. Otherwise complex
             biological processes, such as the effect of the interplay
             between genetic drift and mutation on diversifying selection,
             may now be investigated with minimal effort.
             Frequency-dependent and deterministic selection coefficients
             update techniques are also available.
